This problem relates to carrying data from Knutson et al. 2007, and measuring the dayside and the night side temperature.

Scaled Radius of the planet (Rp/Rs) = 0.1504 pm 0.0040
Scaled Distance to the planet (a/Rs) = 8.84 pm 0.27
Peak to Peak Amplitude (A): 1100 pm 100
Secondary Eclipse Depth (Delta) = 3400 pm 100
Effective Stellar Temperature (TEff) = 5023 K pm 150K
